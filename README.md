#  Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project

> This project is part of **our ongoing Data Analysis Series**, where we explore real-world datasets, apply data science techniques, and develop deployable machine learning solutions.

---

## üìä Project Overview

In this project, we built an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict **Customer Satisfaction Ratings (1 to 5)** based on support ticket data, including both structured and unstructured inputs. After processing and modeling the dataset, we deployed a working web application using **Flask** that allows users to interactively input data and get real-time satisfaction predictions.

A custom HTML/CSS interface was developed to provide a clean and intuitive UI.

## üìà Workflow in the Notebook (`Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction.ipynb`)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Data Collection & Exploration

* Loaded raw dataset and inspected structure, types, and null values.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

* Removed invalid entries and focused on 'Closed' tickets with satisfaction ratings.
* Handled missing values, standardized column names.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized distribution of ratings, customer demographics, and ticket types.
* Analyzed key patterns in satisfaction levels across different ticket types and genders.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Feature Engineering

* Created features like `Response Time Delta`, `Tickets per Customer`, `Months Since Start`
* Added sentiment scores using VADER
* Applied **TF-IDF** to ticket descriptions
* Performed **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding** on categorical variables

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Model Building

* Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
* Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**
* Trained **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers
* Saved the final XGBoost model and preprocessing tools using `json`

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Model Evaluation

* Evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **f1-score**, and confusion matrix
* Analyzed accuracy by ticket type category
* Final accuracy: \~22%

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Model Explainability

* Applied **SHAP** to understand global feature importance
* Identified top predictors: `Months Since Start`, `Product Purchased`, and `Sentiment`

## üåê Web App Deployment (`Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction_Project-FLASK_APP`)

### üîß Flask Backend (`app.py`)

* Loaded the trained XGBoost model, scaler, and training columns
* Created two routes:

  * `/` renders an HTML form (UI)
  * `/predict` accepts POST request, processes form data, scales inputs, and returns prediction
* Handles missing columns dynamically to match model training features
* Renders predicted rating back to the user in the UI

### üè¢ Frontend Interface (`templates/index.html`)

* HTML form collects input fields like:

  * Customer Age
  * Product Purchased
  * Sentiment
  * Response Time
  * Gender
  * Ticket Type
  * Tickets per Customer
  * Months Since Start
  * Age Group
* Clean and user-friendly layout with dropdowns, number inputs, and placeholders

### üåà Styling and Image Support (`static/img.jpg`)

* Custom **CSS styling** applied via `<style>` tags in HTML
* Background image set using `img.jpg` placed in `static/` directory
